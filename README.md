# The Legacy of the Taliban on Female Education in Pakistan

## Overview
This repository contains the research and analysis conducted to explore the impact of the Taliban's influence on female education in rural Pakistan. The project aims to understand how Taliban control has affected school enrollment rates among girls in these regions.

## Objective
To investigate the causal effects of Taliban presence on girls' access to education in rural areas of Pakistan by comparing school enrollment rates between Taliban-controlled and non-controlled villages.

## Methodology
- **Data Source**: Utilized data from the Pakistan Living Standards Measurement (PSLM) survey, which covers a wide range of demographic and educational indicators.
- **Analytical Approach**: Employed a difference-in-difference (DiD) analysis to estimate the causal impact of Taliban control on female school enrollment rates, ensuring that the comparison between control and treated groups is statistically robust.

## Findings
The study found no significant average effect on the enrollment rate for girls in Taliban-controlled areas, suggesting that while there are regional disruptions, the overall influence of Taliban control on female education might be less than previously perceived.
